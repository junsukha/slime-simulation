# slime-simulation

## Original code: https://github.com/FelipesCoding/slime_mold/tree/main
The original code uses sfml over version 2.x while this repo uses 3.0.
I also use vcpkg to install sfml. 

To use sfml v.3.0, I made minor changes in the code such as the way using functions as there're some changes between sfml v.2.x and v.3.0.
